# Foundation Sprint Workshop - GitHub Pages Implementation Requirements

## Project Overview
Create a secure, single-page workshop facilitation tool for conducting Foundation Sprint workshops. The tool should work entirely client-side, be hosted on GitHub Pages, and allow teams to capture and export their strategic decisions.

## Core Functional Requirements

- Optional: Create `CNAME` file for custom domain

### 2. Data Persistence & Security

#### 2.1 Local Storage Implementation
- Implement auto-save functionality that saves all form inputs to localStorage every 30 seconds
- Create unique storage keys using workshop date/time: `foundationSprint_${timestamp}`
- Implement data encryption using Web Crypto API or simple base64 encoding for basic protection
- Add function to list all saved workshops in localStorage
- Implement selective data clearing (keep templates, clear only workshop data)

#### 2.2 Password Protection
- Implement simple JavaScript-based password protection on page load
- Store hashed password in code (not plain text)
- Show password prompt before revealing workshop content
- Add "Remember me for 24 hours" option using sessionStorage
- Redirect to blank page if password is incorrect

#### 2.3 Session Management
- Implement 4-hour session timeout with warning at 3.5 hours
- Show popup warning allowing users to extend session
- Auto-save all data before session expires
- Clear sensitive data from memory on session end

### 3. Workshop Navigation & Progress Tracking

#### 3.1 Module Navigation
- Implement smooth scrolling between modules
- Add visual progress indicator showing completion percentage
- Mark modules as "completed" when all required fields are filled
- Prevent navigation to next module until current module has minimum required fields completed
- Add keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+Arrow keys) for module navigation

#### 3.2 Timer Functionality
- Implement countdown timer for each module with recommended durations:
  - Module 1 (Basics): 90 minutes
  - Module 2 (Differentiation): 90 minutes  
  - Module 3 (Approach): 90 minutes
  - Module 4 (MVP & Hypothesis): 60 minutes
- Add pause/resume functionality for breaks
- Show visual and audio alerts when time is running low (5 minutes remaining)
- Log actual time spent on each module for future workshop optimization

### 4. Interactive Features

#### 4.1 Note-and-Vote System
- Implement drag-and-drop sticky notes functionality
- Add voting dots (3 per person) that can be placed on sticky notes
- Show vote counts on each item
- Highlight items with most votes
- Add "Decider Override" button to select final choice regardless of votes

#### 4.2 Rating System
- Implement 5-star rating system for differentiators and approach evaluation
- Calculate and display average ratings across all participants
- Show visual comparison of ratings between options
- Export ratings data with final results

#### 4.3 Real-time Hypothesis Building
- Dynamically update Founding Hypothesis as fields are completed
- Highlight missing elements in red
- Show completion percentage for hypothesis
- Validate that hypothesis makes grammatical sense

### 5. Data Import/Export

#### 5.1 Export Functionality
- Implement "Download Results" button that exports to multiple formats:
  - PDF with formatted workshop results and visual elements
  - JSON with all raw data for technical teams
  - Markdown file for easy sharing and documentation
  - CSV with key decisions for spreadsheet analysis
- Include timestamp and participant names in exports
- Add company/project name to export filename

#### 5.2 Import Functionality  
- Allow importing previous workshop JSON to continue work
- Implement template importing for common industry patterns
- Add "Start from Example" option with pre-filled data
- Validate imported data structure before loading

### 6. Collaboration Features

#### 6.1 Sharing Capabilities
- Generate unique shareable link with read-only view of results
- Implement QR code generation for easy mobile access
- Add "Copy to Clipboard" for all key decisions
- Create shareable image of Founding Hypothesis for social media

#### 6.2 Multi-device Support
- Ensure responsive design works on tablets and phones
- Implement touch-friendly controls for mobile devices
- Add pinch-to-zoom for 2x2 charts and visual elements
- Test on iPad Pro, iPhone, and Android tablets

### 7. Visual & UX Requirements

#### 7.1 Theming
- Implement light/dark mode toggle
- Save theme preference to localStorage
- Ensure all colors meet WCAG AA accessibility standards
- Add high-contrast mode option for accessibility

#### 7.2 Interactive Elements
- Add smooth animations for module transitions
- Implement hover states for all interactive elements
- Show loading states during save/export operations
- Add confetti animation when workshop is completed

#### 7.3 Print Styling
- Create print-specific CSS for clean physical output
- Hide navigation and interactive elements in print view
- Ensure all content fits on standard letter/A4 paper
- Add page breaks between major sections

### 8. Error Handling & Validation

#### 8.1 Input Validation
- Validate required fields before allowing module completion
- Show inline error messages for invalid inputs
- Prevent common mistakes (e.g., same customer and competitor)
- Add character limits for text fields (e.g., 200 chars for hypothesis elements)

#### 8.2 Error Recovery
- Implement try-catch blocks around all localStorage operations
- Show user-friendly error messages
- Add fallback for browsers with localStorage disabled
- Implement data recovery from browser cache if localStorage fails

### 9. Analytics & Insights

#### 9.1 Workshop Analytics
- Track time spent on each module
- Count number of ideas generated vs. selected
- Calculate decision consensus (vote distribution)
- Generate insights report on workshop effectiveness

#### 9.2 Pattern Recognition
- Identify common patterns in differentiation choices
- Suggest similar successful examples from a pattern library
